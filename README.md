# 100DaysOfCode.Azure.Functions

As part of my [#100DaysOfCode](http://www.100daysofcode.com/) challenge I have created an Azure Function that will automatically tweet my daily update based on the log I add to my [100DaysOfCode repo](https://github.com/stvnhrlnd/100DaysOfCode/tree/master/Steven).

All of the code is in [*PublishTweet.cs*](https://github.com/stvnhrlnd/100daysofcode-azure-functions/blob/master/100DaysOfCode.Azure.Functions/PublishTweet.cs) and it's pretty well documented. Quick and dirty for sure, but that's part of the fun ðŸ™‚
